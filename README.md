# To run Cuda Kernels:

Step 1:
cd cpp1/cpp1/Cuda kernels

Step 2:

Compile -

make symmetric

make upper

make gemmoptimized

make diagonal

./symmetric

./upper


./gemmoptimized

./diagonal





# To Compile GPU codes 

Enter into src folder then actiavte Python Environment
source venv/bin/activate

to run basic test cases  for gen xgen ,gen xsymmxgen x diagonal enter-(Only inside src folder)
python main2.py


runner_cuda.py is main file to run cuda code which is in src/dsl.
